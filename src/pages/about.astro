        <h2>Hello, I'm an artist.</h2>
        <p>
          I work across digital illustration, traditional painting, photography,
          and mixed media. My practice explores the intersection of texture,
          color, and memory — finding beauty in layered compositions and everyday
          moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          After studying fine arts, I began blending traditional techniques with
          digital tools. Each piece starts as an idea captured in a sketchbook
          before evolving into its final form, whether that's a screen print, a
          digital painting, or a photographic series.
        </p>
        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>
          My work is driven by curiosity about how materials interact. I
          gravitate toward combining unexpected textures — rough charcoal with
          smooth digital gradients, found paper with photographic prints. The
          tension between analog imperfection and digital precision is where my
          most honest work lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe art should feel approachable. Whether exhibited in a gallery
          or shared on a screen, each piece is an invitation to pause and look a
          little closer.
