There's a particular kind of satisfaction in running your fingers over a textured surface — dried paint ridges on canvas, the tooth of cold-press watercolor paper, the grain of weathered wood. Texture is information. It tells you something words and flat color can't.

## The Pull of Imperfection

When I started working digitally, everything felt too clean. The undo button was both a blessing and a trap. I could make a perfect gradient, a flawless line, a noise-free fill — and somehow it felt empty.

That's when I started combining mediums. I'd paint something messy and honest on paper, scan it in, then push it further with digital tools. The result had the best of both worlds: the warmth and unpredictability of physical media with the precision and flexibility of digital.

## What I've Learned

A few things I keep returning to:

- **Happy accidents matter.** A coffee ring on a sketch, a brush that splayed wrong, a scan with dust on the glass — these "mistakes" often become the best parts of a piece.
- **Limitations are productive.** Working with a limited palette or a single tool forces creative problem-solving that infinite digital options never do.
- **Process is the point.** The finished piece matters, but the hours spent experimenting, failing, and discovering are where the real art happens.

## What's Next

I'm currently working on a series that pushes this idea further — starting with found materials (old book pages, fabric scraps, rusted metal fragments) and building digital compositions around them. Stay tuned for updates in the gallery.
